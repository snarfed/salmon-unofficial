functionality
===

consider single global list of domains (and fb users if necessary). show all on
front page, let people add.

UX:

web sites: opt in OR do discovery on all?

probably need to start with a whitelist. but expand to all later? tough to
scale, right?


users: opt in OR crawl all public posts?

similarly, start with a whitelist. expand to all later though? opt in for
private too? what's social networking etiquette? 

implementation details:
twitter has firehose for crawling all public posts.
facebook has...?


salmon generation:
1. poll source (FB/Twitter) for posts with links, searching either by opted in
   users or by domains. use cron job or repeating task.
2. look for comments and replies to those posts.
3. if any replies, fetch link content and do salmon discovery. may also need to
   do discovery on associated feed?
4. for each reply, look for existing entity/task. add them if reply is new.
   (see section 9 of salmon spec for how to generate reply aka salmon guids.)
5. in task processor, send salmon to endpoint. mark task completed if endpoint
   returns 202 or 200.

get this running.

then:
5. do the same for mentions, which are basically post-independent replies.

testbed
===

http://salmon-net.appspot.com/

"Your salmon endpoint is: https://salmon-net.appspot.com/salmon/3dUzgc3lq5XzmGwfTXnN1v1X-pom8dbTVkerl3oX3do
Adding the following link element to your LRDD XRD, will cause your salmon to be sent to this net.
<link rel="salmon" href="https://salmon-net.appspot.com/salmon/3dUzgc3lq5XzmGwfTXnN1v1X-pom8dbTVkerl3oX3do" />
In order to facilitate testing, performing discovery on acct:3dUzgc3lq5XzmGwfTXnN1v1X-pom8dbTVkerl3oX3do@salmon-net.appspot.com will lead to the endpoint above..
You can pick up the Salmon sent to this net here: https://salmon-net.appspot.com/feed/vi__gddYhK5U7wkZnmusC1qkqwcJUGKLFEFpPjVu3sY
That endpoint is kind-of a secret so only you will know where to pick up your salmon. If you lose it, you'll have to create another net.
This feed will be using the PSHB hub at http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com."

salmon and magic sig python lib(s)

http://code.google.com/p/salmon-protocol/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Flib%2Fpython%2Fsalmon

looks decent but the salmon part may need a few bug fixes?

https://github.com/paulosman/django-salmon
looks good, but tightly integrated w/django
