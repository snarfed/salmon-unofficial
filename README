This is a stand-in, proxy Salmon server for sites that don't implement it
themselves. It currently has implementations for Facebook and Twitter, served at
these endpoints:

http://facebook-salmon.appspot.com/
http://twitter-salmon.appspot.com/

Feel free to add more!

Background on Salmon:
http://salmon-protocol.org/

Twitter and Facebook support OAuth, which you'll need to use for pretty much
everything. If you obtain an OAuth access token from Twitter or Facebook and
include it in a request to this provider, it will be used to sign and authorize
the underlying requests to those providers. See the demos on
https://facebook-salmon.appspot.com/ and
https://twitter-salmon.appspot.com/ for examples.

To use this in a Salmon client, you'll need to hard-code exceptions for the
facebook.com and twitter.com hosts and redirect Salmon HTTP requests to the
corresponding endpoint above.

Note the app.yaml.* files, one for each App Engine app id. To work on or deploy
a specific app id, symlink app.yaml to its app.yaml.xxx file. Likewise, if you
add a new site, you'll need to add a corresponding app.yaml.xxx file.

The tests require the App Engine SDK and python-mox.

Deploy commands:
rm -f app.yaml && ln -s app.yaml.twitter app.yaml && \
  ~/google_appengine/appcfg.py update . && \
rm -f app.yaml && ln -s app.yaml.facebook app.yaml && \
  ~/google_appengine/appcfg.py update .
