This is a Salmon conversion library and proxy server for sites that don't
implement the Salmon protocol themselves. It's deployed at
http://salmon-unofficial.appspot.com/ , and currently has implementations for
Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Feel free to add more!

It's part of a wider collection of OStatus and federated social web tools for
Facebook, Twitter, and Google+:
